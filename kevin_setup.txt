- modified test_single.json

    - changed number of tetrodes to 4 tetrodes, 1 ripple process, and 4 encoder processes
- edit supercell_hostfile.mpi, replace supercell with my computer's hostname

- downloaded anaconda3, avoided last PATH modification in install script
- edited run_script.sh
    - replaced all instances of python3 with path/to/anaconda3/python
    - replaced -bind-to core to -bind-to hwthread, because my laptop has 4 physical cores only
    - replaced mpiexec with mpiexec.openmpi
- env MPICC=/usr/bin/mpicc.openmpi ENV=/path/to/anaconda3/pip install mpi4py

- ran with "./run_script.sh 8 config/supercell_hostfile.mpi config/test_single_modified.json"


Integrating:

- comment out/remove all simulator process related code
- each rank has a PythonClient object
- MainProcess has its own MainprocessClient object
    - on Play, call handle_ntrode_list()
    - on Stop, or Quit, call trigger_termination()
- BinaryRecordTypeMessage and TimeSyncReport messages still not recognized and fixed
